PopShop - The Smart Shopper's Assistant. 

PopShop is an app that "learns" your shopping habits and applies what it learns to streamline your shopping needs. 

By creating categorized item lists (i.e. electronic, hardware, grocery, etc.), these persistent lists will pop up on demand or when appropriate, once PopShop is activated.  

For instance:

  During a shopping session a corresponding list of items will pop up in a clickable queue.  As the shopper purchases items,     they are checked off and stored for later analysis and use. When the next shopping session occurs, the list will display 
  the most purchased items at the top of the queue.  Items that are not purchased will simply drop off after a set period of
  time. As time progresses, a series of "smart" lists will have been constructed and will execute each time the shopper enters 
  or approaches a corresponding retail establishment.  

Additional functionality: 

  PopShop enables easy expansion by creating and/or modifying new or existing lists to meet specific shopping needs; 
  
  For active lists, PopShop can find the nearest x stores, x miles from the current location, that sell specific items; 
     
  PopShop can display current purchasing trends and enable forecasting for future purchasing decisions; 
  
  PopShop can print any active list to the nearest available printer for easy reference.
